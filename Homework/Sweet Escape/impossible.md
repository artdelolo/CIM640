SWEET ESCAPE APP

PURPOSE & FEATURES

Sweet Escape is a smart suitcase with an integrated mobile application that helps users hop on a plane or train and travel the world in as little time as possible.

Sweet Escape takes a user’s desired travel dates, budget, travel party size, and traveling style to book and plan a random full vacation from start to end.

The application will book your flights (based on your current location), hotel rooms, excursion tickets, transportation between locations, and meal reservations.

The smart suitcase will also print out all your tickets (you will have a copy on your mobile device) and also pre-pack your suitcase based on your final destination.
